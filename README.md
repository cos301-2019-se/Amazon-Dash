# Amazon Dash

## Project description:
The aim of this project is to streamline and simplify the Amazon Web Services dashboard. The application is meant to recommend the most optimal instances of service with regards to region, cost and how well it will integrate with existing services. The application should also include other features that will give the user more control and insight over their AWS account, such as a kill-switch, user alerts and metrics and cost estimators to name a few.
